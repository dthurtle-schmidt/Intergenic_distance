# Intergenic_distance
To identify divergent genes and calculate the intergenic distance

This file first finds genes in the C. elegans genome that are divergent. Then to import a cuff_diff file and determine gene pairs that are divergent and differnetially regulated. The output it s tab delimeted file.
